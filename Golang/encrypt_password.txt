Generate a 16-byte AES key file once:
head -c 16 /dev/urandom > aes_key.txt

Run the tool to encrypt your plaintext password:
go run encrypt_password.go "MyPlainPassword123" aes_key.txt > db_password.enc
Deploy your aes_key.txt and db_password.enc files with your compiled binary to the server.
Your Go app will read these files, decrypt at runtime, and connect securely.
